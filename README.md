**Styling & Implementation Notes**

This project uses SCSS (SASS) for styling, compiled to CSS using the Live Sass Compiler extension in VS Code to ensure browser compatibility.

As per the given instructions:

Arial is used as the base font (custom fonts were intentionally ignored).

Bootstrap or any CSS framework has not been used.

Responsive breakpoints are implemented using media queries directly within SCSS.

The layout and styles are written using HTML5 and CSS3 best practices.

Please review the implementation and feel free to let me know if any additional changes, enhancements, or clarifications are required.
